# Uber-Bookings-Analysis-Dashboard-Power-BI-SQL-Project

A full-scale **Power BI dashboard project** analyzing Uber bookings using **SQL for data extraction** and **Power BI for data visualization**. This project simulates real-world reporting for a ride-hailing service, featuring ride patterns, vehicle performance, cancellations, revenue analysis, and ratings ‚Äî all backed by dynamic and interactive visuals.

## üß† Dashboard Pages Overview

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Overall Booking Summary**

This page gives a high-level summary of total bookings and booking value. It includes:

* **Booking status breakdown** through a pie chart (e.g. success, cancelled by driver, incomplete, etc.)
* **KPI indicators** displaying total bookings and total booking value
* **Ride volume over time** visualized with a line chart
* **Date slicer** to dynamically filter the visuals

This gives stakeholders a quick understanding of daily activity and booking outcomes.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Vehicle Type Analysis**

This page explores ride trends and operational metrics by vehicle type:

* **Tables and cards** showing metrics like total distance traveled, average distance per ride, and revenue generated by each vehicle category
* Helps in understanding which vehicle types contribute most to operations

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Revenue Breakdown**

Dedicated to tracking Uber‚Äôs revenue performance:

* **Bar charts** for daily revenue and revenue by payment mode
* **Pie chart** comparing weekday vs weekend performance
* **Table listing top 5 customers** by booking value

Gives strong insights into customer lifetime value and preferred transaction methods.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Cancellation Analysis**

This page dives into cancellation patterns:

* **Pie charts** breaking down cancellations by customer and driver with reason categories
* **KPI cards** showing cancellation rate and success rate

Useful to identify areas where user experience or driver engagement may need improvement.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Ratings Overview**

This page evaluates service quality using customer and driver feedback:

* **Matrix visuals** comparing average customer ratings and driver ratings per vehicle type

Helps understand satisfaction trends and pinpoint segments with low service scores.

üîç SQL Analysis Performed

Before building the dashboard in Power BI, comprehensive data analysis and preparation was done in **SQL**, including:

* Filtering data by date ranges to support time-series analysis
* Aggregating booking values, distances, and ratings by dimensions like vehicle type, date, and user ID
* Segregating booking statuses to calculate successful rides vs cancellations
* Ranking top customers based on spending
* Creating daily revenue summaries and cancellation summaries

The data extracted via SQL served as the foundation for Power BI's visual reporting and DAX-based calculations.

## üìå Why This Project Stands Out

* Mirrors a **real business intelligence workflow**: from raw data ‚Üí SQL extraction ‚Üí Power BI modeling ‚Üí dashboard delivery
* Covers **multiple business domains**: operations, customer service, revenue, and performance
* Designed with a clean, professional UX ‚Äî aligned for business teams
